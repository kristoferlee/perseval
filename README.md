##Persistent Evaluation Versioning 2.0.2.1

Perseval version numbers are constructed using the following format:

**FOUNDATION.PHASE.FEATURE.FIX**

1. Increment the **FOUNDATION** member when the project changes on a fundamental level.

2. Increment the **PHASE** member when you begin working on a planned or apparent set of features or upgrades.

3. Increment the **FEATURE** member when you publish additions or upgrades within the context of the current phase.

4. Increment the **FIX** member when you publish repairs on features, within the context of the current phase, that are known or discovered to be faulty.

5. Additional optional members may be added to indicate the projectâ€™s disposition, status, or other non-instrumental information.
